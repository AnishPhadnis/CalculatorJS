# Fully Functional Basic Calculator Using Javascript
This project uses HTML/CSS/JS to create a calculator that can handle basic arithmetic, decimals, order of operations, and errors like having more than 1 decimal in a number. The UI takes inspiration from Apple's Calculator design. 

# Motivation
While learning about DOM manipulation through JS, I wanted to work on a project that truly tested my skills and forced me to be resillient and resourceful. Throughout the course of this project, I've run into more roadblocks than I can count but I persevered and finally finished my calculator. 

# Credits
Thank you to the Odin Project for teaching and guiding me through this project.
